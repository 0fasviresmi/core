1. In the "Editors" section of the main window, choose the component that you want to edit the license for. For example, if you want to edit the license for the text editor, select "Text Editor".
2. Go to the "License" menu and click on "Edit License". This will open a new window where you can enter or modify the license text.
3. If you have already created a license for this component before, the system will automatically find and load the license file for you. You can then edit the text as you wish. If you have not created a license before, the system will ask you to specify the location and name of the license file. By default, the license file is stored in the same folder as the program, and it is named licences.

When you are done editing the license text, click on "Save" to save your changes. You can also click on "Cancel" to discard your changes and close the window.
  
The License Enabler License file editor also allows you to view the details of each license, such as the expiration date, the number of users, and the terms and conditions. To do this, select the license file in the "License Files" section of the main window, and then click on "View License" in the "License" menu. A window will open where you can see the license information. You can also print or export the license as a PDF file.
 
If you want to remove a license from a component, you can do so by selecting the component in the "Editors" section, and then clicking on "Delete License" in the "License" menu. A confirmation message will appear, asking you if you are sure you want to delete the license. Click on "Yes" to proceed, or "No" to cancel. Note that deleting a license will disable the component until you add a new license.
 
The License Enabler License file editor is a useful tool for managing your software licenses. It helps you to create, add, edit, delete, view, print and export licenses for different components of the software. You can access this tool from the "License" menu of the main window.
